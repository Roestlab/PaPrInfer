# ParsimoniousProteinInferencer

1.. It might need a better name

2. It is a protein inferencer based on the IDpicker's algorithm
from this journal article

3. visualization package used seems to be not powerful 
enough to plot a bipartite graph with 43079 
proteins and 86941 peptide (pre-collapse) or 9321
proteins with at least the same amount of peptides

4. EPIFANY refers to the tool reference in this paper.

5. The code for an implementation of IDPicker used for this project, while
not removed from here yet, is being package and made available
PyPI and it is associated with another remote repository
