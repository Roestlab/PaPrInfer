# ParsimoniousProteinInferencer

1. This project is still quite disorganized

2. It might need a better name

3. It is a protein inferencer based on the IDpicker's algorithm
from this journal article

Zhang, B., Chambers, M. C., & Tabb, D. L. (2007). Proteomic parsimony through bipartite graph analysis improves accuracy and transparency. Journal of proteome research, 6(9), 3549â€“3557. https://doi.org/10.1021/pr070230d

4. visualization package used seems to be not powerful 
enough to plot a bipartite graph with 43079 
proteins and 86941 peptide (pre-collpase) or 9321
proteins with at least the same amount of peptides
